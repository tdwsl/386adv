Bugs!!! Bugs in my assembly code!!!

I got bugs in my code - it was awful. And yeah, I get it - "Bugs in
my assembly code? How very unlikely, how could I ever have predicted
that this would happen?" - but I really thought I was doing good!

Maybe sometime I'll try fixing the bugs, but until then I won't be
working on this :(
