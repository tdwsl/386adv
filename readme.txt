-38.6 C Adventure

This is a text adventure for x86 Linux, written in 386 assembly. It is
unfinished. Technically, you can win, but only because I wanted to wrap it up;
it is very short.

Even though I got bored with it, this is my first real assembly project and my
pride and joy when it comes to assembly programming. It uses a text parser, so
the player interacts with commands like "look at [noun]" or "put [noun] in
[noun]". Quite a few things are implemented, and even though it's unfinished,
I'm happy with the way it turned out!

Read the assembly file for instructions on assembling.
